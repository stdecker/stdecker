- ðŸ‘‹ I'm Stephen. I'm a PhD student in the department of Kinesiology at UMass Amherst. My work focuses mostly on mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle and endothelial/vascular
function, and how those are altered by things such as aging and disease. I also have a general interest in the coupling of O<sub>2</sub> delivery and utilization throughout the body,
including the production of ROS/RNS. I mostly work with high-resolution respirometry, <sup>31</sup>P-MR Spectroscopy, Doppler Ultrasound, and various other techniques 
([see my CV](https://github.com/stdecker/DeckerCV)). Beyond the 40-100 hours I'm working in research, I enjoy outdoor activities, :baseball: (former D1 athlete), cooking (especially
smoking BBQ :no_smoking:), and forever embarrassing my family with endless shenanigans.
